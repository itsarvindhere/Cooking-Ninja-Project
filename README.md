Cooking Ninja Project made while learning React from The Net Ninja's Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/course/build-web-apps-with-react-firebase). 

Added some extra features in this one such as

  - Alerts upon addition, removal or updation of Recipes
  - Search Functionality (With Firestore)
  - Ingredients Error Messages
  - Removing Ingredients that are added while creating or updating recipes
  - Animated Loader instead of text based Loading message

Better to test on desktop. UI Not responsive yet so it will look horrible on Mobile xD
